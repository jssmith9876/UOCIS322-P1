# README #

A "getting started" project for CIS 322, introduction to software engineering,
at the University of Oregon.

### What is this repository for? ###

The objectives of this mini-project are:

  * Experience with GIT workflow with separate configuration:
  Fork the project, make and test changes locally, commit;
  turn in configuration file with reference to repo.
  (Project 0 is practice for this part.)
  * Extend a tiny web server in Python, to check understanding of
  basic web architecture
  * Use automated tests to check progress (plus manual tests for good measure)
